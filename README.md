# Full-stack Bookings Application

A robust MERN stack platform for seamless accommodation booking, inspired by Airbnb.


## Overview

1. Airbnb Clone: The Full-stack Bookings Application is a dynamic platform that draws its inspiration from Airbnb, a renowned leader in the accommodation booking industry. This project aims to replicate the convenience and functionality of Airbnb while offering a unique experience to users.

2. My First MERN App: This project marks a significant milestone as it is my inaugural venture into developing a full-fledged application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) stack. It represents a journey of learning, growth, and the application of modern web development technologies.

3. User-Friendly UI: At the heart of the Full-stack Bookings Application is its user-friendly interface. We've prioritized the ease of use for both hosts and guests, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience. Navigating through the application is designed to be straightforward, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

4. Accommodation Listings: The core functionality of this platform revolves around accommodation listings. Hosts can effortlessly create detailed property listings complete with descriptions, images, availability calendars, and pricing information. This feature allows guests to discover, evaluate, and book accommodations that suit their preferences and needs.


## Key Features

1. User Authentication using JWT:
The Full-stack Bookings Application employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication. Users can register and log in to the platform, and JWTs are generated to authenticate and authorize their access to various features and resources.

2. Password Hashing and Secure Storage:
User passwords are hashed using bcrypt.js, a powerful encryption library. Hashed passwords are securely stored in the MongoDB database, ensuring that sensitive user data remains protected.

3. Signup and Login Functionality:
Users can easily sign up for the Full-stack Bookings Application by providing their details. Upon successful registration, they can log in with their credentials. A secure and straightforward authentication process is in place to safeguard user accounts.

4. Booking Functionality:
One of the core features of the application is its booking functionality. Users can browse accommodation listings, select their preferred dates, and book accommodations. 

5. Editing Booked Places:
Users have the flexibility to manage their booked accommodations. They can make changes to their booking details, such as modifying dates or the number of guests. This ensures that users have control over their travel plans.

6. MVC Architecture Implemented:
The Full-stack Bookings Application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This separation of concerns enhances code organization and maintainability. The application's structure is divided into models (for data handling), views (for user interfaces), and controllers (for handling user requests and interactions).

These key functionalities work together to create a robust and user-friendly experience within the Full-stack Bookings Application.
